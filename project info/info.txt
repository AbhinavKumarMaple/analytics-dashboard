FULL STACK DEVELOPER – TASK
This task is designed to assess your ability to replicate a complex data dashboard and build
a complete full-stack web application. The outcome will demonstrate your capabilities in
frontend and backend development, product thinking, and initiative. Please approach this as
you would a real-world feature assignment.
1. Overview
You are expected to build a fully functional web application that replicates a Power BI
dashboard, based on the wireframes we will provide. You may use any technology stack that
best suits the problem, with the aim of delivering a clean, responsive, and user-friendly
interface with dummy data.
2. Objectives
2.1 Dashboard Replication
You will be provided with visual wireframes (screenshots) representing the desired UI
layout and components. Your task is to closely replicate the layout, interaction, and styling
using the frontend technology of your choice.
2.2 Web Application Development
Your solution must include the following:
• Frontend Requirements:
• - Dashboard UI replication as per wireframes
• - Table with sortable/filterable dummy JSON data
• - Static chatbot widget (no logic needed)
• - Navigation (top bar or sidebar)
• - Map feature with polygon drawing, dummy pins, and filtering
• Backend Requirements:
• - `/login` route with hardcoded authentication
• - `/data` route to serve table and map data
• - Optional: JWT/session authentication
2.3 Personal Contribution Requirement – ( BONUS )
You must include at least one additional feature or improvement that you believe will
enhance the usability, performance, or value of the web application. This is your
opportunity to showcase your product thinking and creativity.
3. Deliverables
Your final submission must include:
• - GitHub repository with all source code (frontend + backend)
• - Live frontend link (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)
• - (Optional) Hosted backend link (e.g., Render, EC2, Railway)
• - README file with the following:
• - Tech stack used
• - Setup instructions
• - Explanation of your own added feature
• - Challenges faced and how you resolved them
• - (Optional) Screenshots or video walkthrough
4. Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
• - Code quality and architecture
• - Accuracy in UI replication
• - Creativity and value of added feature
• - Product thinking and initiative
• - Clean and deployable solution
5. Timeline
You will have five (5) days from the time of receiving the wireframes to submit your
completed task. Late submissions will not be accepted.
6. What We Will Provide
• - Screenshots/wireframes of the target dashboard
• - Dummy dataset
